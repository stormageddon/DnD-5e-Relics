These files contain a Javascript application and data file for rendering random single-use magic items for the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons. The spells.csv and spells.json contain D&D 5e spell information including name, level, castable as higher level, uses DC, uses attack bonus, and the page number from the PhB. This data is used to build each magic item.

This script can be called from another page to display a selectable number of magic items.

Enjoy!
